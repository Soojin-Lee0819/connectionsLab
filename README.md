# connectionsLab

Welcome to Soojin's ConnectionLab Project Portfolio. Here, exploring the online experiences that bring people tegother in playful yet meaningful ways, I designed and developed diverse connected web applications from data visualizations to multi-player games. Working with both the cleint-side and the serverside, I learned how to build a project end-t-end from ideation, development to user-testing. I also learned how to manage and work with data, gained comfort working with Javascript languages and the ecosystem of open source Javascript libraries, and leveraging real-time communication through purposeful design.
