## Project Brief
A person's name tells a lot about one’s identity. Albeit subconsciously, once we hear the name, we immediately associate the name with the person’s gender, nationality, and even age - all associated with the name. For example, my name “Soojin” is a typical Korean female name in Korea that people who are familiar with Korean culture would immediately build a profile of myself upon introduction. For this project, using three APIs (agify API, genderize API, nationalize API), that predicts the age, gender, and nationality of the given name, I plan to create a data visualization game. There are two elements to this project. The first is data visualization and the second is gamification. For the data-visualization part, players simply need to type in the name and click the submit button to receive visual data about the name’s predicted age, gender, and nationality. For the game part, players need to be more proactively participating in the game by typing in as many diverse names as possible. The goal of this game is to type in as many names as possible that aren’t from the same country, age range (10s, 20s, 30s ...), and gender category. If the player type in two names that shares all three identities (gender, age, and nationality), the data visualization they made so far will disappear and the page will reset. This game is for people who are curious about the cultures, human diversity, or people who live in a diverse community like members of NYUAD. Through the process of playing, I hope players have fun finding different names from different backgrounds but also think critically about the biases and labels that exist in names and identities.
