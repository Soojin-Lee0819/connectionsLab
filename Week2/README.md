### Overview

For week 2, I learned how to make interactions using Javascript. Inspired by my Notion planner that I use everyday to stay productive, I created an interactive To-do List page for this week's assignment. I wanted to create a weekly To-do-list page, similar to the notion page I am using, with a motivational quote slideshow on top. This project has two main user-interactivities; motivational quote slideshow that moves on click, and to-do list user-input interactivity that has user-input, add/delete button, checkbox functions.

To prevent an error, I added a function where if user adds 

3) Along with click 

For the color, I used Pantone's Very Peri color, the color of the 2022.

### Adding Checkbox
At first, to mark completed tasks, I created a class "completed" and added a line-strike when the text is clicked. Without any icon, the process of clicking the completed task to mark it complete wasn't very intuitive. Therefore, I added a checkbox, that visually signals users to clcik on the checkbox at completion.

### Reflections 

Although it is simple and uncomplicated for the user, to develop the working system, there were a lot more thought put into the process. For example, . I want to improve it by adding. 

For my next project, I want to learn how to write more effecient code. I also want to add the function where users can drag and move tasks from one list to another.

One concern with this web-based weekly to-do list is that without a log-in system, once the tab is closed, the input data is not stored. For example, if the user write, in order to achieve, there should be a log-in feature where the input data can be stored and can identify the user and once the log-in
