### Overview

For week 2, I learned how to make interactions using Javascript.

I wanted to create a weekly To-do-list page, similar to the notion page I am using, with a motivational quote slideshow on top. This project has two main user-interactivities; Motivational quote slideshow click, and to-do list user-input interactivity that was more complex to build.
