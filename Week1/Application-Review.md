### Why did I choose this Connected-Application?
I chose to critique Song Maker because I was amazed by its minimalistic design, excellent accessibility, intuitive UX, and how entertaining it is to play around with. Without a complicated tutorialization or a knowledge on music, it helps people to be creative and share creativity with others. I also love music in general so I was interested to play around with this application. 

### What is working?
1) First, it is highly accessible. As a web-based application, Song Maker is accessible on any device such as laptop, ipad, or mobile. Users can simply click on the website address and start making music. There is no neeed to download. 


2) Second, Song Maker has an incredibly simple UI that is intuitive for the users. It avoids tutorialization by making the process super simple and easy to navigate. Users simply fill in boxes to create notes and press play button to listen to the music they created. The colorful-colors of the boxes are visually attractive and the grey shadow that follows the note that is currently playing helps users visualize sound. Without having any knowledge on the notation system, users can be creative. 


3) Third, it gives users control and flexibility on how they want to create music. Users can touch/click or use keyboards to create sound. For users who are more experienced with music making, they can connect midi to make more advanced songs. Users can even turn on the mic to sing a note. There is also customization feature where users can choose instruments. To change the instrument, users need to click on the icon button that looks clickable. 

4) Forth, Allow error and exit. There is an undo button at the bottom right corner. When user wants to edit or undo, they can simply click undo button to go back go previous stage or users can also click on the colored blocks directly to delete the note. 

5) Fifth, ability to archive for later, and share with others. While the music making process itself is done along, it allows users to save their creative work and share with others. When clicked save, the website gives users with a link that can be shared. It also gives options to save as MIDI file or wav file, or an embed code.


### What can be improved?
Overall, I think this application is made with great consideration on user experience and helps users to be creative with technology. 

Some of the points that can be improved are:

1) Mic feature is not very responsive. When I make a sound with a mic on, it detects my voice well but hardly finds a matching note. I can't make a continuation of notes. I have to project one note at a time and hold it for 1-2 seconds for it to detect and log the sound. The sensitivity of the mic can be improved or let the user know that they have to hold the sound for 1-2 seconds.

2) Add erase everything button. There is an undo button, which goes back to the previous entry. However, there is no clear button to restart the page. 

3) Add social media share button. Users can copy link and share it on the social media of their choice but there is no direct link to share it on social media. By helping an extra step for make it easier for the users to share, it will increase more users to actively share creative work with others.
