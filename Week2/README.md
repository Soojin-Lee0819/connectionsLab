## Reflection & Evaluation

I want to develop this project by adding price of the beverages to the dataset. On webpage, I want to make a quick survey, either checkbox or user-entry for users to filter the beverage of their choice. I also want to add images for each beverage and have it displayed on the side. Having to npm start for any changes made in index.js file was a bit frustrating. I was wondering if there are any automatic version of this.
