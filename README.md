# connectionsLab

Welcome to Soojin's Connection's Lab Project Portfolio. In this class, I design and develop web applications that include both client-side (front-end) and server-side(back-end). Exploring tools and technologies, create meaningful connected applications like website, data visualizations, and multi-player games. Hope you enjoy reading my learning documentation and the projects!
