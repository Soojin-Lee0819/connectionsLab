## Overview
For this week, I have created a project that visualizes of Starbucks nutritional label using D3 library. The prompt was to use one of the library; D3, Three.js, Ml5, Aframe, Tone.js, Rivescript, Leaflet.I experimented with D3. 


## Reflection
I feel like I am not using the library to its full potential.
