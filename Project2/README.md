### Project Brief 

This game is inspired by Expo 2020 where the visitors go around different pavilions to experience the unique culture of countries around the world. Similarly, in this game, players would explore the campus of NYUAD while visiting different campus pavilions including D2, C2,  A2, and the Field. In each pavilion, the players would play a different 2-player game. 

On the landing page, there would be a map of campus with 4 clickable locations as well as the total number of players inside each pavilion. The players pick the pavilion of their choice and get redirected to a specific game page. At the Track & Field pavilion, players can play tug of war against each other. At the C2 admissions office, players can play a game where they need to collectively write down all majors on campus, and if they write the same major twice, they lose. The third pavilion is D2, where players are given an order and their goal is to complete as many orders as possible (the gameplay mechanism will be a click and pick). The last pavilion is a classroom in A2 where the players would play Pictionary.

### Wire Frame
This is the initial wireframe I made focusing on the structure of the webpage and how users' would access each game. On landing page, users will be given the map of NYUAD with the locations highlighted to enter. When users click the location, they will be directed to the according game page.

Using figma, I have designed the landing page. At first, I used the 3D modelling map of NYUAD. Here, I added location pin with the real-life images of the location in the shape of bubble. After discussing with Alia, we decided to use the 2D map of NYUAD with the part of the map highlighted.

We also designed the quick mockup of each game room to make sure the visual interface is consistent throughout the game. Although each game has its own unique features, by making the background consistent with image overlay and the title on the top, we made sure that the game feels - one big game with four minigames, rather than four separate games.

### Developing Game Mechanics 

Two of the game mechanics were already developed from our previous assignment - C2 | Pictionary from my NYUAD Pictionary Game and D2 | Tug or War from Alia's previous Tug of War game. Two other games were designed with the idea of making use of the location. For D2 (school cafeteria), we decided to create a game where the two players are given with a string of order, and they need to click images to fill the tray. For A2, we wanted to make a game where the students need to remember majors at NYUAD as quickly as possible. 

Following are the games at NYUAD Expo 

1) A2 | Major Hunt
1) C2 | Pictionary
2) D2 | One MealsSwipe
3) Field | Tug of War

### Next Step

The next steps for this game is clear: I want to improve on cleaning the visual elements of the game, make the accumulative score system where the players can collect points from different mini-games and have it shown on the map. 

The idea is
